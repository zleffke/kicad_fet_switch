# kicad_fet_switch
High Current, DC, High Side, P-Channel MOSFET Switch.  Based on W6PQL design.

### Credit where its due:
[High Current DC Switch](https://www.w6pql.com/high_current_solid-state_dc_switch.htm) from W6PQL.

This design is the identical circuit, just a kicad implementation and variations on the layout for my own projects.

#### Versions:

high_current_v1 - initial prototype design, fixed resistors, no mounting screw, all SMT.
 - Rev- sent to Osh Park, 20200601

high_current_v2 - Same base design, variable resistors for R1, R5, R6 to set for any range up to ~50V.
